    <p>I am Joaquin Padial, an aspiring artist who wants to combine their love of coding, video games, and art to eventually find a career in game design. I have been posting my artwork for 2 years, documenting my artistic progress. I was originally posting every weekday, but because of school, I changed it to every friday to give myself time to come up with new ideas and not feel pressured to draw something big everyday.</p>

    <p>I also make animations for my youtube sometimes. I have been teaching myself how to animate for a while and I hope to use this for when I make my own games.</p>
